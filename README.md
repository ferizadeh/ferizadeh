# Hi there 

I'm a **AI Scientist** with a robust background in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. I specialize in predictive modeling and data visualization, transforming data into actionable insights. With a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms and neural networks, I develop models that can make accurate predictions and uncover hidden patterns in data.

My current research focuses on Explainable AI (XAI), which aims to make AI models more transparent and understandable to humans. By enhancing the interpretability of AI systems, I strive to build trust and facilitate their integration into real-world applications.

In addition to XAI, I have a strong interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their capabilities. My goal is to explore their potential in various domains, particularly in the biomedical field.

I am passionate about the biomedical applications of AI, including medical data analysis, neuroimaging, and cancer research. By applying AI techniques to these areas, I aim to contribute to advancements in healthcare and improve patient outcomes.
